English Lyrics:

(Intro)
As soon as I say it! It repeats!
I will meet you at the end of despair!
It's a blessing in disguise, it's a blessing in disguise!
Hoping for the end, of infinity at the end of the abyss!

In the world, in the world, in the world.
To take back everything in this world.
In the middle of death, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of everywhere.
Disappearing in endless deaths,

It's a blessing, a blessing, a blessing, a blessing, a blessing!
Memories found on a false path,
Close your heart, In a closed heart

No death, no death, no death, no death, no death.
I will plunge countless blades of death into you.
It's over, it's over, it's dying, it's dying, it's ending.

The pain of death that never ends!
Disappear!

As soon as I say it, I say it.
I will meet you at the end of despair
It's okay to say goodbye, and it's okay to pray.

Hoping for the end of infinity at the end of the abyss
When I feel sorry for someone, I feel sorry for myself.
To open our eyes to the truth in the depths of evil

In the middle of the disease, in the middle of the night.
Even if we share the pain, in pitch black darkness
To see the sight, to feel private, to experience
A repeating landscape, a voice calling me

Back to back.
The truth hidden in regression!
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!)
The memories recovered there surpass death.

As soon as I say it, I say it.
I will meet you at the end of despair.
It's a blessing in disguise, it's a blessing in disguise.
Hoping for the end of infinity at the end of the abyss!

In the world, in the world, in the world.
To take back everything in this world

In the middle of death, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of nowhere
Disappeared in endless death

It's a blessing, a blessing, a blessing, a blessing, a blessing
Memories found on a false path
Close your heart, In a closed heart.

No death, no death, no death, no death, no death.
I will plunge countless blades of death into you.
It's over, it's over, it's dying, it's dying, it's ending.
The pain of death that never ends, disappear

As soon as I say it, I say it.
I will meet you at the end of despair
It's okay to say goodbye and it's okay to pray.
Hoping for the end of infinity at the end of the abyss
When I feel sorry for someone, I feel sorry for myself.
To open our eyes to the truth in the depths of evil."

zetsubō no! hate de! anata o mukaeru!
naraku no! hate de! mugen no wari ya
inotte! kono sekai no! Subete wo!
ubaikaesu tame ni!

hateshinai shi no naka kiete shimatta!
itsuwari no michi de mitsuketa kioku,
towazarete ita kokoro no
musū no, shi no ha o anata ni uchikomu
towari ni warana shi no itami! kiesare!

zetsubō no! 'te de! anata o mukaeru!
naraku no! hate de! mugen no wari ya

Hitomi o akete mo, kurayami no naka
kurikaesu keshiki, watashi o yobu koe
kaiki ni, kakureta -- sono shinjitsu
soko kara torimodoshita, kioku shi o norikoe
